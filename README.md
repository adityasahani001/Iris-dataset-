# Iris-dataset-

The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in Machine Learning and is often used for classification problems. It was first introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936 and contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
Each sample has four features (measurements in centimeters):

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
The goal is to classify the iris species based on these features. The dataset is widely used for pattern recognition, classification, and data visualization.

It is available in CSV format on Kaggle and can be loaded using pandas. Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib help in understanding patterns and relationships between the features.
